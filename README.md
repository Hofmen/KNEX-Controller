# KNEX-Controller
Knex Controller

For my technology teacher training, I had to design and build a finished product, so I decided to level up my K'Nex building skills. I've always loved K'Nex, and I even made a remote-controlled motor before, but it wasn't very polished.

This time, I wanted to create something that looked and felt like an official K'Nex product. So, I designed and built a wireless remote control that can operate up to 4 motors using Arduino. It's still a work in progress, but I'm really happy with how it's turning out!

Unfortunately, due to my busy schedule with work and studies, I'm not able to continue working on this project at the moment. However, if anyone is interested in taking it further, I've uploaded all the project files (code, 3D models, etc.) over here. Feel free to use them as a starting point and build upon my work. If you need any additional information or resources, just let me know!
